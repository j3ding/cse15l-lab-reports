# **Lab Report 1**

## ***Step 1  Installing VScode***
I installed VScode on my computer from a previous CSE class. 
* To install, using [this link](https://code.visualstudio.com/). VScode looks like this after opening it. \

## ***Step 2  Remotely Connecting***
Try to log in using the CSE 15L account by typing `ssh cse15lwi23acy@ieng6.ucsd.edu` in VScode terminal. \
* This may cause a system error by changing the Active Directory password. Try several times to enter the password. \
This fails, so try to log in using UCSD personal email (should still use CSE 15L account next time). \
