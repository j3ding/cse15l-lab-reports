3. Start the timer.
4. Log into ieng6 on the terminal of VScode by typing the command `$ ssh cs15lwi23xxx@ieng6.ucsd.edu` where `xxx` differs for different student accounts. Since have used this account for last log in, can directly press `<up><enter>` in the terminal instead of typing. The terminal would look like this if successfully log in.
* Note: if fails to log in using the course account, can use the student email `$ ssh <email>@ieng6.ucsd.edu` to log in.

5. Clone the fork from personal Github account using `$ git clone <url>`.
